# ðŸ§ª Drug Discovery â€“ COVID-19 Activity Prediction

This dataset contains molecular data for potential drug candidates against the COVID-19 virus.  
Each compound is represented by its chemical structure (SMILES) and several computed molecular descriptors, with the target variable `pIC50` indicating antiviral activity (higher = more effective).

**Task:** Regression â€“ predict antiviral activity (`pIC50`) from molecular properties.
